Publishers & Subscribers = Observer pattern
- Much like a magazine subscription.

'Official' Definition:
    The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when
    one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Bullet Points
- The observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects
- Subjects update observers using a common interface
- Observers of any concrete type can participate in the pattern as long as they implement the Observer interface.
- Observers are loosely coupled in that the Subject knows nothing about them, other than that they implement the Observer interface.
- You can push or pull data from the Subject when using the pattern. (Pull is considered more correct)
- The Observer pattern is related to the Publish/Subscribe pattern, which is for more complex situations with multiple subjects and/or multiple message types.
